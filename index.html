                <h3>Front-End </h3>
                <p>Front-end development involves creating the visual and interactive aspects
                    of a website or web application that users directly interact with. This includes the
                    design, layout, and behavior of everything users see on their screens, such as buttons,
                    forms, images, and animations. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and 
                    JavaScript to build user-friendly interfaces and ensure they work smoothly across different
                    devices and browsers</p>

                <p>Backend development involves building and managing the backend of websites and web
                    applications, which handles the data and logic that users don't see. This includes
                    databases, servers, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Backend developers
                    use programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP to build application logic,
                    process data, and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and the databases.

                <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital
                    attacks. These cyberattacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information,
                    extort money from users, or interrupt normal business processes. Implementing effective
                    cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices
                    than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

                    improving and updating the software to meet users' needs. Developers use various programming
                    languages, frameworks, and tools to build applications for different platforms, such as
                    web, mobile, desktop, and cloud.

                    from data, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perceiving the
                    environment. AI technologies are used in various applications like voice assistants, 
                    recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and much more.
